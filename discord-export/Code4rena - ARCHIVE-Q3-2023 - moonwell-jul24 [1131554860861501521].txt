all addresses for testnet are here https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-moonwell/blob/main/test/proposals/Addresses.sol

we don't know mainnet addresses yet because chainlink has yet to publish the addresses for their mainnet base price feeds

did the feed.decimals always return 8 in this line?
```
// Chainlink USD-denominated feeds store answers at 8 decimals
        uint256 decimalDelta = uint256(18).sub(feed.decimals());

[07/28/2023 16:08] 0xarz
if there is a feed that does not exist like wsteth/usd then they have to deploy a composite oracle where the base is eth/usd, multiplier eth/steth and secondMultiplier is the wsteth / steth exchange rate and then this contract is set in the ChainlinkOracle contract

[07/28/2023 22:23] elliot0x
a community member will deploy and if governance accepts their deployment, a vote will happen on moonbeam to ratify and instantiate that market. if the community accepts the deployment, then it will be used.
